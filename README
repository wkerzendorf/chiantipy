What is ChiantiPy
=================

ChiantiPy is the Python interface to the CHIANTI atomic database for astrophysical spectroscopy

Detailed information can be found at http://chiantipy.sourceforge.net

What is CHIANTI
===============


The CHIANTI provides a database of atomic data that can be used to interpret the emission of spectral lines and continus emitted from high-temperature, optically-thin astrophysical sources.  The CHIANTI project provides a suite of routines written in Interactive Data Language (IDL) to access the database and calculate various quantities for use in interpreting observed spectra or producing synthetic spectra.

Getting started with ChiantiPy                                                                                                                
==============================                                                                                                                

Prerequisites
-------------

* Python ( version <= 2.6; not compatible with version 3.X )

* Numpy

* Scipy

* Matplotlib

* [Optional] PyQt4 or wxPython

* CHIANTI_, the atomic database for astrophysical spectroscopy

.. _CHIANTI: http://www.chiantidatabase.org

In addition, the FortranFormat module from Scientific Python, developed by Konrad Hinsen of the Centre de Biophysique Moleculaire (http://dirac.cnrs-orleans.fr/ScientificPython/), is included in this distribution for simplicity.

Installing the CHIANTI database
----------------------------

The gzipped *data* tar ball can be downloaded from the CHIANTI website_

.. _website: http://www.chiantidatabase.org/download.html

*  put the file in a convenient directory, cd to the directory and untar the file

* ChiantiPy uses the environment variable *XUVTOP* to find the database.  Set XUVTOP to the name of the directory where the CHIANTI data tarball was placed.  For example

> setenv XUVTOP /data1/xuv/directory.where.the.tarball.was.placed

Some sites have the CHIANTI database maintained as part of a SolarSoft distribution.  In that case, simply set XUVTOP to the directory were it exists, usually something like $SSW/packages/chianti/dbase


Installing the ChiantiPy package
-----------------------------

The ChiantiPy package can be downloaded from the ChiantiPy, untar it, cd to the directory where it was unpacked, and then, as root

> python setup.py install

If you do not have root privileges, simply put the ChiantiPy directory (simply called 'chianti') in your PYTHONPATH


ChiantiPy Defaults
------------------

To some degree, the ChiantiPy is governed by a small set of default values.  Some of these specify the abundance file and the ionization equilibrium file.  Others specify whether wavelengths are give in Angstroms, nm or kev, whether fluxes are given in photon fluxes or energy fluxes in ergs.  Finally, they specify whether the PyQT4 gui toolkit (qt) or the wxPython tookit (wx) are used for the various interactive dialogs.  The easiest way to specify these is to copy the chiantirc file in the source distribution into your ~/.chianti directory.  This is the text file and can be modified to specify these settings.  If ChiantiPy does not find this file, it uses its own builtin defaults.


Running ChiantiPy
-----------------

The documentation can be found on its web page ChiantiPy_

.. _ChiantiPy:  http://chiantipy.sourceforge.net/

In particular, a quick start guide is included which should get you up and running fairly quickly.


Keeping track of ChiantiPy
--------------------------

There is a mailing list that you can subscribe to at https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/chiantipy-users.  In order to subscribe it is first necessary to obtain a user account from sourceforge.net.  This is a straightforward process.
