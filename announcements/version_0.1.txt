Dear colleagues,

We are pleased to announce the release of ChiantiPy version
0.3, a Python package for calculating synthetic spectra from
the CHIANTI atomic database for astrophysical spectroscopy. 
ChiantiPy provides the same functionality as the existing
IDL package.  One benefit of ChiantiPy is that it uses
Python, a freely available programming language.  ChiantiPy
is constructed as an object-oriented package that provides a
good match to the modular construction of the CHIANTI
database itself. Our intention is to maintain both the IDL
and Python packages for the indefinite future.

This release features the inclusion of the mspectrum class
that allows users to use multiple local cpu cores for
spectral calculations that can be time consuming.  In
addition, there are numerous bug fixes.

The documentation for ChiantiPy can be found at

http://chiantipy.sourceforge.net/

and the software package can be downloaded from

http://sourceforge.net/projects/chiantipy/

Python is available for Windows, Mac OS, Linux and Unix. 
ChiantiPy itself has been developed on a Linux platform and
has received most of its testing on Linux.  In software
development terminology, it is an 'alpha' release, meaning
it has not really undergone sufficient testing in a variety
of environments.  We welcome reports of user's experiences
on the chiantipy-users email list on Sourceforge:
chiantipy-users@lists.sourceforge.net

In addition, several discussion forums have been set up at
