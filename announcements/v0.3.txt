I am pleased to announce the release of ChiantiPy version
0.3, a Python interface to the CHIANTI atomic database for
astrophysical spectroscopy.  The main new features of this
release are the inclusion of the mspectrum class that make
use of multiple processors on a local computer.  This can
greatly speed up calculations of emission spectra.  In
addition, there are numerous bug fixes.

ChiantiPy is intended to provide all of the functionality of
the Interactive Data Language (IDL) procedures that are
distributed by the CHIANTI team.  Python is a modern,
object-oriented, high-level programming language that is
well suited for performing spectral calculations with the
CHIANTI database.

More detailed information is available at the ChiantiPy
website:

ChiantiPy has been developed on a Linux platform and has
received some testing on MacOs but none on Windows.  Since
this is the first release, it would be useful to hear about
successes and problems with ChiantiPy.  The best place for
this would be the mailing lists that are listed on the
website above.
